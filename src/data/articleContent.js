Tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have built empires on the back of our clicks, likes, and shares.

However, I believe the tech industry doesn't need to innovate for innovation's sake. Instead, it should focus on solving real problems that people face. Products should emerge from genuine needs rather than the desire to create the next shiny gadget. If the industry redirected its efforts towards addressing actual issues—rather than churning out a million browsers or phones with marginally better cameras—the world would undoubtedly be a better place. It's time to prioritize meaningful innovation that truly enhances our lives.`
